Introduction
The Social Event Planning and RSVP System will be a web application allowing users to create and manage events, invite participants, and handle RSVP responses. The application will leverage modern web technologies such as Vue.js, Bootstrap 4, and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) to ensure a dynamic, responsive, and secure user experience. Core features include user authentication, session management, and real-time event updates using AJAX. The project will also focus on delivering a secure, mobile-first experience using SSL and session cookies.
